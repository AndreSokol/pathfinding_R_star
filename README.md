## Introduction

*Abstract*

## Tools used

This work is based on code written for ISA RAS researches in order to achieve compability with their huge set of pre-generated tests. That is the main reason to choose the following tools:

**Programming language:** C++, XML (for input files)    
**IDE:** QtCreator 3.6.1    
**Compiler:** qmake + MinGW         
**External library:** TinyXML 2 (for parsing input files)
